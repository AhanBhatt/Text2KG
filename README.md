# Text2KG
This repository contains a Python-based project that automates the creation of knowledge graphs (KGs) from text using OpenAI's GPT-4 API. It leverages PDF document parsing, natural language processing, and graph visualization techniques to extract entities and relationships from unstructured text and represent them as a directed graph.
